# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction – CODSOFT Internship Task 2

As part of my **Data Science Internship at CodSoft**, I worked on predicting IMDb movie ratings using machine learning regression techniques.

## ✅ Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates IMDb movie ratings based on features like:
- Genre
- Director
- Lead Actor
- Number of Votes

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: [IMDb Movies India (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)  
File name: `IMDb Movies India.csv`

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- Linear Regression

## 🧪 Steps Followed

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Label Encoding for Categorical Variables
3. Feature Selection
4. Train/Test Split
5. Model Training with Linear Regression
6. Model Evaluation using MSE and R² Score

## 📊 Results

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.86  
- **R² Score:** 0.035

This model is a basic starting point and can be improved using advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
