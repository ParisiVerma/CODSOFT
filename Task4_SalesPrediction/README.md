# ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction using Python

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **CodSoft**.

## ðŸš€ Objective
To build a linear regression model that predicts product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.

## ðŸ§  Dataset
Dataset used: `Advertising.csv`  
Source: Kaggle - [https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 2.91
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.91

## ðŸ“Œ Output Plot
A scatter plot was generated to compare actual vs predicted sales values based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper ad budgets.
