# ðŸŒ¸ Task 3: Iris Flower Classification â€“ CODSOFT Internship

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **CODSOFT**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) using petal and sepal measurements.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

---

## ðŸš€ What I Did:
- Loaded and cleaned the Iris dataset
- Visualized data using Seaborn (pairplot, heatmap)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Built a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## âœ… Results:
- The model achieved **high accuracy**
- Confusion matrix showed very few misclassifications
- Successfully classified flowers into their correct species

## ðŸ“½ Video Demo:
Will be shared on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) and added here after upload.

---

## ðŸ”— GitHub Link:
Will be added after uploading to GitHub.
